			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>My name is Doug Miller.</p>
			<p>I like people and I like technology. In fact I like them both so much that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design">I did an entire degree in them.</a></p>
			<p>What I really like the most however is knowledge. I love helping people comprehend and engage with the the world around them with visualisations, collaborations and interactions.</p>
			<p>I use a whole different bunch of tools to help me do this: Java, Python, embedded systems, prototyping, sketching and a whole bunch other cool tools and techniques.</p>
