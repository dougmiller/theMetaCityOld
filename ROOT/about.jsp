			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>My name is Doug Miller.</p>
			<p>I like people and I like technology. In fact I like them both so much that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design">I did an entire degree in them.</a> I am, however, currently working as a sleep technologist (long story don't ask).  I also help people manage their digital presence on occasion.</p>
			<p>What I really like the most however is learning. I use this site to explore new (to me) technologies that help people collaborate, comprehend, explore and engage with the world around them.</p>
			<p>I use a whole different bunch of tools to help me do this: from straight up building in Python, Java, PostgresQL, bash et. al. to to mocking and designing in pencil and paper, kerning and CMYK. I love prototyping with demo and proof of concepts in both digital and physical artefacts often using arduino but branching out into my own designs and etches.</p>
			<p>I really do feel that information wants to be open and free and so pretty much everything on this site is published under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia License.</a> However there is a <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/">different one for code specifically</a>.</p>
